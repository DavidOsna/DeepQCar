# DeepQCar
Car driving around track - DQN 

This is my first AI Project.
I implemented the environment myself with pygame. The car is controlled by a Deep Q Network. 
In order to see the car driving - run main_test. 
If you want to keep training the model - run main and uncomment the specific line.
